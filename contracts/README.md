# REGISTRY Smart Contract


# Overview
The REGISTRY smart contract is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to register and store specific information on the blockchain. Each user is assigned an arbitrary number as a reference for their registration.

# Features
User Registration: Allows users to register on the blockchain, storing their data with a unique reference number.
Arbitrary Reference Numbers: Users are provided with arbitrary numbers as a reference for their registration.
No Encryption/Decryption: For simplicity, this contract does not currently utilize encryption/decryption keys. All data stored on the blockchain is not encrypted, and users should be aware that their information is accessible in its raw form.
Smart Contract Language: The contract is written in Solidity and interacts with the Ethereum blockchain.

# Limitations
Data Visibility: Since the contract does not use encryption, all stored data is visible on the blockchain. Users should only store non-sensitive information.
Arbitrary Reference Numbers: The reference numbers are arbitrary and not inherently secure. They are meant for simple referencing within the contract.


# Future Improvements
Encryption/Decryption: Future versions of the contract may include encryption and decryption mechanisms to enhance data security.
